# 🛒 E-Commerce Data Analysis (MySQL)

## 📌 Overview
An end-to-end SQL project focused on extracting business intelligence from a transactional e-commerce dataset(Data). This project demonstrates database schema management, advanced querying, and performance optimization within **MySQL Workbench**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Tool:** MySQL Workbench

## 🧠 SQL Implementation & Skills
### 1. Data Aggregation & Logic
* Utilized `SUM()`, `AVG()`, and `COUNT()` alongside `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to isolate high-value sales trends.
* Implemented complex **Subqueries** to benchmark individual product performance against global averages.

### 2. Relational Data Modeling
* Performed multi-table **Joins** (INNER, LEFT) to consolidate customer profiles with transaction history.
* Developed **Database Views** to store reusable logic for frequently accessed reports (e.g., *Category Performance View*).

### 3. Performance Optimization
* Applied **Indexing** on high-traffic columns (`Customer_Id`, `Order_Date`) to reduce query execution time.
* Optimized filtering logic to ensure scalable performance as the dataset grows.

## 📈 Key Business Insights
* **Top Performers:** Identified the highest-grossing product categories and seasonal sales peaks.
* **Customer Behavior:** Segmented users by lifetime value and purchasing frequency.
* **Profitability Analysis:** Evaluated how discount strategies influenced net profit margins.
* **Tech Metrics:** Compared revenue contribution across different devices and payment gateways.
